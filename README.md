# Antonio-Alteracoes-Hackathon
Single Page App project developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript during the &lt;A/C> Bootcamp' Hackathon

The goal was to make an SPA based of one of António Variações songs. In our case was the song "Sempre Ausente".
This project was developed by a team of 6 and allowed us to apply part of our knowledge of HTML, DOM and JQuery, CSS, JavaScript and Agile/Scrum methodology.

## Description

The SPA suggests, according to a user questionnaire based on the philosophy of António Variações, to change user's life. In this sense, the app will suggest a new hairstyle, clothing and entertainment place for the user to change their life.
This project was more of a gag and not to be taken very seryously, and it was fun.

## Project Status

Finished.
